# pi_air_data
Personal project focused on gathering temperature, humidity and pressure data from a Raspberri Pi setup, and plotting collected data

Design Intent is as follows:

1st: Program a Raspberri Pi to collect psychrometric data (temperature, pressure, and humidity) and create a CSV to show changes over time.  
2nd: If possible, wirelessly transmit that data either to a PC or directly to GitHub.  
3rd: Generate a program to read the generated CSVs and save it to an ongoing df.  
4th: Plot the data over time, and possibly compare it to other weather forecasts.  

Ideally this project can be a framework for future projects, where data can be created, transmitted and analyzed from a Raspberri Pi.
