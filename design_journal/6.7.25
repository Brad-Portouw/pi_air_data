Subject: Finding datasets

Looking online NOAA has published weather datasets available that are likely a good fit for the psychometric data that I am looking for.

The dataset that will likely be the best fit is found in the Climate Data Online Normals Daily section. The sample data is given as a CSV so I plan on importing it to investigate it's viability.

Ideally the dataset contains local hourly data for:

1. Temperature
2. Pressure
3. Relative Humidity

And ideally has:
4. Heating and Cooling degree days


With a reliable source of weather data it would be a great exercise to scrape this data regularly, then compare it to my own results.
