Writing a journal to practice recording my design thoughts.  
I want to pursue designing a data collection device that could help develop my python skills while also learning to use a Raspberri Pi, which I haven't used before.  
I suppose it is also an opportunity to learn markdown a bit better too.  
A place to start would be with a cheap sensor that collects psychrommetric data, then upload it either to my pc or github. From there it can be analyzed in a python file, and plots can be made.   
Collecting psychrometric data is relevant way to utilize my knowledge of both HVAC design and data analysis. Ideally I could collect my personal data and compare it to weather forecasts during the same time period.    
Comparing the data collected to weather forecasts can show how well the insulation and air handling unit control the comfort of the house.  

To start I'm going to do some research on how well a Pi can collect data, and then what sensor to use. A friend of ours had a sensor that used a prewritten library to collect psychrometric data, perhaps that would be a good place to start.
